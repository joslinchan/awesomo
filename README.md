Awesomo is a mini search engine to help you find colours and other inspirational items for your next amazing project. Picking colours and images can be a real struggle, but Awesomo can help!

Awesomo runs on a Rails backend with a Postgres database, and React on the frontend with Bootstrap and a large of of custom css. The frontend and backend are combined with Webpacker and React Rails so that this app runs on a single server along with a compiler.

## Getting Started

This project uses the following:

* Ruby 2.5.1

* Rails 5.2.0

* Webpacker 3.5.5
